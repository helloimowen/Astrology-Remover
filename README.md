#Astrology Remover

Astrology Remover is a browser extension by Owen Sanders for his innovation 180 final. It is based heavily on Tumblr Savior by Bjorn Stromberg.

The main purpose of this extension is to get rid of bad astrology memes on tumblr. I added a pre-filled-in blacklist and whitelist and modified the CSS. 

The original source code can be found at [https://github.com/bjornstar/Tumblr-Savior](https://github.com/bjornstar/Tumblr-Savior).
